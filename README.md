My solutions for the [Advent Of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/) event. 

All solutions are in Python.

Instructions:
- Create and activate a Python environment (eg. with [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html))
- Install all requirements in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) with `pip`. (`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Create a `.env` file containing the environment variable `AOC_SESSION=...`. The value of this variable should be the value of the cookie on AOC (see [here](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1))
- You should be good to go!
